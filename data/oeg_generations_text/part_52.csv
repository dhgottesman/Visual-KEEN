0,Q17987985,Greg Orton," Greg Orton is a highly accomplished educator, author, and speaker who has dedicated his career to helping students and educators improve their literacy skills. He is the founder of the Orton-Gillingham approach, a multisensory teaching method that focuses on the explicit, systematic, and sequential teaching of literacy skills to individuals with dyslexia and other language-based learning disabilities.

Orton was born in 1918 in the United States and grew up with a strong interest in education. He earned a Bachelor's degree in English from Harvard University and later completed a Master's degree in education from the University of California, Berkeley. He began his teaching career in the 1940s and quickly realized that many of his students struggled with reading and writing.

Orton began to research the causes of these learning difficulties and developed the Orton-Gillingham approach in the 1950s. This approach emphasizes the use of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic aids to help students with dyslexia and other language-based learning disabilities learn to read and write. The approach is based on the idea that individuals with dyslexia have difficulty processing the sounds and symbols of language, and that teaching these skills explicitly and systematically can help them overcome their challenges.

Over the years, Orton's approach has been widely adopted by educators around the world. He has written several books on the topic, including ""The Science of Reading"" and ""The Science of Dyslexia."" He has also given countless lectures and workshops to educators and parents who are interested in improving literacy skills for individuals with dyslexia and other learning disabilities.

Despite his many accomplishments, Orton remained humble and dedicated to his work. He passed away in 2005, but his legacy lives on through the countless individuals whose lives he has touched through his research, teaching, and writing."
